       <h1>50% Off FORTNITE Deluxe Edition</h1>
       <p>The base Fortnite game is on sale right now, and if you pick it up, you’ll have ample time to participate in the Lunar New Year event going on before it ends February 22.
       Those who’ve been wanting to give Save the World a go can pick up Fortnite for 50% off.
      This deal spans all editions on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Again, this is Save the World, as Fortnite Battle Royale is free to play.
      Here’s how it all breaks down:
      Fortnite Standard – $19.99 instead of $39.99
      Fortnite Deluxe – $29.99 instead of $59.99
      Fortnite Super Deluxe – $44.99 instead of $89.99
      Fortnite Limited Edition – $74.99 instead of $149.99
      Keep in mind the Ultimate Edition, which is made available as an option once the Limited Edition is purchased, is not on sale.<p>
