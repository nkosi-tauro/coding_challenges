<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li style="font-size:160%;">600-700 piece of fillet steak</li>
  <li style="font-size:160%;">2 heaped teaspoons French mustard</li>
  <li style="font-size:160%;">8-10 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce , plus extra for drizzling</li>
  <li style="font-size:160%;">a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</li>
  <li style="font-size:160%;">2 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
</ul>

<center><h2 style="font-size:200%;">Directions</h2></center>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The day before, or at least a few hours before cooking, put all the <em>ingredients</em> in a large sandwich bag (pick and finely chop the rosemary first).
Squeeze out the air then spend a few minutes massaging all the flavours into the meat.</p> <p style="font-size:160%;">Put in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">About <b>1½ hours</b> before you’re ready to cook, remove the beef from the fridge and place in a cool corner of the kitchen to come up slowly to <b>room temperature.</b>
<strong>Preheat your barbecue</strong>. Put a few knobs of chilled butter into a bowl of <em>cold water</em>  and take those outside with you when you’re ready to cook.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This next bit is going to be down to you and your intuition. What works for me every time is taking the fillet out of the bag, <em>quickly patting it with kitchen paper then rolling it in olive oil</em> and putting it on the hottest part of the barbecue to give it colour. Rub it with a <em>chilled knob of butter</em> as you cook it for about <b>8 to 10 minutes</b>, turning every minute. Once it looks good, move the fillet to a cooler part of the barbecue to finish cooking to your liking. Another <b>4 to 5 minutes</b>, turning every minute, should give you medium-done meat.</p> <p style="font-size:160%;">If you like it medium rare, cook it for less, or more for well done. It’s better to err on the side of under-done. That way, the worst-case scenario is that you take the fillet off, slice into it and find that it’s under-cooked, then have to put it back.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">When you’re happy, put it on a platter, rub it again with butter so it really shines, then drizzle over more <b><em>Worcestershire sauce, extra virgin olive oil</b></em>, and thyme and rosemary flowers, if you have them.
<p style="font-size:160%;">Let the meat <b>rest</b> for a few minutes, before slicing at the table. Season from a height then quickly rub the slices in the <em>juices before you let everyone grab some</em>.</p>

 <p style="font-size :110%;">“This is the most delicious barbecued beef I think I’ve ever had (even if I say so myself). Trust me because it’s going to go really dark and look burnt, but it’ll be perfect inside if you do it right. ”</p>
